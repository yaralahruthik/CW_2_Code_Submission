# Game of Life Collection

This repository is a collection of two projects, each implementing a different version of the classic cellular automaton, Conway's Game of Life. 

## Submodules

This repository contains the following submodules:

### Game of Life 2D

This is a 2D implementation of Conway's Game of Life. In this simulation, each cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 

For detailed information, refer to the [Game of Life 2D README](https://github.com/Nestian/game-of-life/blob/56254274462bd731a5c70fbc680a82cb13c33df8/README.md) or navigate into the submodule folder.

### Game of Life 3D

This project is a 3D extension of the original Game of Life. It adds an extra dimension to the interaction of cells, introducing a whole new complexity to the game dynamics.

For more details about this project, check out the [Game of Life 3D README](https://github.com/yaralahruthik/game-of-life-3d/blob/e863a151b42b5dcbac8b92c82a4dbee4199c2df1/README.md) or navigate into the submodule folder.

## Cloning the Repository
